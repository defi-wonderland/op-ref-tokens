# Solidity Security Guidelines

## Security Patterns
- Use CEI pattern (Checks-Effects-Interactions)
- Prefer custom errors over require statements
- Include comprehensive NatSpec documentation
- Emit events for storage changes
- Inherit interfaces last to avoid linearization issues

## Best Practices
- Solidity ^0.8.0 has built-in overflow and underflow checks. Use `unchecked` blocks for micro-optimizations where overflow is impossible.
- Validate all inputs
- Handle edge cases explicitly
- Follow security best practices
