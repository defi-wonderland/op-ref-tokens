# Solidity Security Guidelines

## Security Patterns
- Use CEI pattern (Checks-Effects-Interactions)
- Prefer custom errors over require statements
- Include comprehensive NatSpec documentation
- Emit events for storage changes
- Inherit interfaces last to avoid linearization issues

## Best Practices
- Use SafeMath or unchecked blocks appropriately
- Validate all inputs
- Handle edge cases explicitly
- Follow security best practices
