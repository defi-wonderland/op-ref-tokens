# Solidity Base Guidelines

## Code Structure
- Order imports: External Libraries → Internal Libraries → Local Interfaces → Local Contracts
- Define events, errors, and structs in interfaces
- Order functions by visibility: external → public → internal → private
- Order state variables: constants → immutable → storage

## Naming Conventions
- Prefix interfaces with "I"
- Capitalize constants and immutable variables
- Prefix internal storage variables with underscore
- Use descriptive, unambiguous names
