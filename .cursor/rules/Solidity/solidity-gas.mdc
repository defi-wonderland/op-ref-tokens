# Gas Optimization Guidelines

## Storage Optimization
- Cache storage variables in memory
- Pack storage variables into single slots
- Keep strings under 32 bytes
- Use appropriate variable sizes (uint48 for timestamps)
- Use mappings instead of arrays when possible

## Computation Optimization
- Use unchecked blocks for safe arithmetic
- Avoid unnecessary storage reads/writes
- Use calldata for function parameters
- Cache repeated calculations
- Use events instead of storage when possible
