# TypeScript Development Guidelines

## Code Organization
- Avoid over-abstraction and prioritize composition over inheritance
- Use dependency injection and follow SOLID principles
- Prevent circular dependencies using the internal module pattern
- Libraries should have an `external.ts` file for public exports

## Type Safety
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` when type is uncertain
- Use runtime type-checking (Zod) for environment variables
- Maintain `bigint` types from external APIs

## Documentation
- Use JSDoc for all code elements
- Document public APIs thoroughly
- Include examples for complex functionality

## Best Practices
- Implement static async factory functions for constructors
- Follow established naming conventions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
