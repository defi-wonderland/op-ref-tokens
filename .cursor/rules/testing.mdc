# Testing and Quality Assurance

- Implement a comprehensive testing strategy including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Use property-based testing to uncover edge cases.
- Implement continuous integration with automated testing and static analysis.
- Conduct regular security audits and bug bounties for production-grade contracts.
- Use test coverage tools and aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths.
- Follow BTT pattern, first defining the test case in the `.tree` file and then writing the actual Unit test.
